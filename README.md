# Euler Project Solutions

## Overall structure of the project
This project consists of:
* EulerConsole, which is the console interface and the 'composition root' of the application 
* Interfaces that contain an ISolvable interface, which should be implemented by the corresponding classes, so that the console application addresses them uniformly
* Problems. Here are all the solutions to every problem. Each solution has a root class that implements the ISolvable interface

The problems solved with a 'Design Patterns' approach. For example:

#### problem 11: Largest product in a grid

In this problem we have to calculate the maximum product of 4 adjacent numbers in a matrix 20x20. By adjacent we mean that the numbers should be continuous in various directions, eg. diagonal, horizontal or vertical. 
To make this problem a bit more challenging, I added a degree of freedom to these aspects:
* the matrix should not have predefined dimensions, the dimensions should be calculated at runtime.
* the matrix should be provided in plain text with space separated values (so that it's easy to import such a matrix from a text file)
* the number of adjacent numbers should be a variable. The problem states 4 adjacent numbers,  but we will treat it as a variable.
* the type of adjacent numbers we are going to calculate (are they going to be diagonal, vertical or horizontal?) This enables us to extend the application to support any type of adjacent numbers (for example a cross).
* the type of calculation (the result here is a product, but we isolate that calculation from the template algorithm)

As a clarification, horizontal, vertical and diagonal adjacent numbers are shown in the matrix bellow.
* vertical -> red
* horizontal -> yellow
* diagonal 45 degrees -> green
* diagonal 135 degrees -> purple

The adjacent mode (horizonal, vertical, diagonal) are modeled with the abstract NumberParserStrategy which has two abstract functions. These functions will be implemented by all the following derived classes:
* Diagonal135DegreesNumberParser
* Diagonal45DegreesNumberParser
* HorizontalNumberParser
* VerticalNumberParser

The related class diagram is shown bellow.

The main idea is that the LargestProductGridSolution class has the main algorithm which is the double iteration over the matrix. For each iteration it will call each of the strategies with the current point (x,y) of the matrix and the strategy will return the corresponding numbers.

With 4 strategies in play the output will be:

```sh
